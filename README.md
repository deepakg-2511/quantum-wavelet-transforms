# Quantum Wavelet Transforms

Quantum circuit implementations of wavelet transforms based on
the seminal paper:

A. Fijany and C. P. Williams,  
"Quantum Wavelet Transforms: Fast Algorithms and Complete Circuits" (1998)

This repository focuses on Haar and Daubechies wavelet transforms
implemented in a PennyLane-compatible style.
